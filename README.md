# saniter ( alpha version )

## 🚀 Overview
saniter is a Python-based tool designed to detect and classify potentially malicious input, specifically focusing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By leveraging machine learning models, saniter provides a robust solution for identifying and mitigating XSS threats in real-time applications.

### Key Features:
- **XSS Detection**: Identifies and classifies malicious input with high accuracy.
- **Pre-checks**: Fast rule-based pre-checks for obvious XSS payloads.
- **Unicode Handling**: Decodes and obfuscates Unicode text to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Extensible**: Easy to integrate into various applications and frameworks.

### Who This Project Is For:
- Web developers and security professionals
- Anyone looking to enhance the security of their web applications
- Data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **XSS Detection**: Detects and classifies malicious input with high accuracy.
- 🔒 **Pre-checks**: Fast rule-based pre-checks for obvious XSS payloads.
- 🌐 **Unicode Handling**: Decodes and obfuscates Unicode text to prevent XSS attacks.
- 🔄 **Extensible**: Easy to integrate into various applications and frameworks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib
- **System Requirements**: Python 3.8 or later
